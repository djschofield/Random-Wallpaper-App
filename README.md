# Random-Wallpaper-App
A GUI-less ChromeOS app to get a random photo as your wallpaper

## How it Works
Once installed from the ChromeOS Webstore, the app places a new application icon in the toolbar. When the user clicks the icon, the app replaces the desktop with a random free-use photo from Unsplash.com
