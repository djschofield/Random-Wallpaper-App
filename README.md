# Random-Wallpaper-App
A GUI-less ChromeOS app to get a random photo as your wallpaper

## How it Works
Once installed from the ChromeOS Webstore, the app pins a new icon in the application shelf. When the user clicks the icon, the app replaces the desktop with a random free-use photo from Unsplash.com.

The application is published on the [chrome webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chromeos-random-wallpaper/opehkmmjdgbkegdfnlaandobnmpininj).

*Note: repository code uses a placeholder instead of my Unsplash API key*
